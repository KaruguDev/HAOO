# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: The first phase is a real discovery-to-onboarding HAOO journey, not a documentation or horizontal foundation phase.
- [Phase 3]: Privacy-first measurement uses bounded coarse browser context with no stable visitor identifier or analytics-to-lead identity join.
- [Phase 4]: Reports describe observable events literally and do not claim delivery or completed onboarding without external evidence.
- [Phase 01]: Use only the four human-approved exact development releases and preserve the existing React 18/Vite 5 runtime stack.
- [Phase 01]: Accept expected RED only when all four named behavior markers appear and no known infrastructure-failure signature is present.
- [Phase 01]: Select the HAOO composition from the physical document body marker while retaining the shared React bootstrap and avoiding a runtime router. — A physical Vite MPA entry provides direct static navigation and crawler-visible source metadata.
- [Phase 01]: Derive the WhatsApp URL only from fixed compile-time product data. — This preserves exact decoded starter text and prevents visitor or analytics context from entering the destination.
- [Phase 01]: HAOO page renders all brochure capability and journey copy verbatim; only the pain and benefit summaries are condensed, and each is assembled from brochure phrases.
- [Phase 01]: Product media paths live in centralized product data (HAOO_PRODUCT.media), keeping ProductPage.tsx a product-agnostic shell and making the partial-media contract testable.
- [Phase 01]: Products navigation is derived from registry presence via productsNavLink() rather than a copied HAOO condition — Couples the nav item and the #products landmark to one source of truth so an empty collection can never leave a dangling anchor
- [Phase 01]: Home-card preview media facts (href, alt, intrinsic size) live in HAOO_PRODUCT.brochure — Keeps ProductsSection free of HAOO literals, reserves aspect-ratio space from data, and makes the optional-media contract testable by emptying the href
- [Phase 01]: Product social image metadata now points at the published /products/haoo/brochure-preview.png — The previous og:image and twitter:image referenced preview-outside.png, which no plan publishes; this plan publishes the supplied preview, so the reference was aligned to the real asset

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Privacy/legal ownership must approve notice, storage, retention, processor, and Kenya Data Protection Act decisions before production collection.
- HAOO mailbox ownership and FormSubmit activation must be available for the Phase 5 production delivery check.
- Analytics account/configuration may be absent; the product journey must remain launchable with the no-op measurement path.
- QUAL-04 production-host proof is blocked at 01-05 Task 3 (blocking-human): an authorized GitHub Pages deployment must land, then both https://www.zero-paperhub.com/products/haoo/ and its brochure PDF must be proven by direct navigation, hard refresh, and checksum. Phase 1 is not complete until this checkpoint is answered.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Lead operations | Searchable leads list, CRM integration, and automated follow-up | Deferred to v2 | Initialization | v1 |
| Attribution | Registration reconciliation and controlled experiments | Deferred to v2 | Initialization | v1 |
| Commercial | Pricing and dedicated tenant/agent funnels | Deferred to v2 | Initialization | v1 |
